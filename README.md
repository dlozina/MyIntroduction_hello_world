# hello-world
Just another new start

Hi all, my name is Dino and I enjoy to program with Python! This is the job I would do even if nobody pays me to do it.
Goal is to become a profesional snake charmer. Find something you love and you will never work again, well I found my joy.

In my new job I am working as Machine Vision programmer and luckily I have a chance to work with C# and .NET platform.
So I will have a loot of C# code on my remote. We are also using HALCON sw, and I can say it does the work. With HALCON it is very easy to solve complicated vision tasks.
