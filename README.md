# hello-world
Just another new start

Hi all, my name is Dino and I love to program! No matter if it is a Robot, PLC or new GUI application I just want to design high quality application and improve my engineering skills.
Find something you love and you will never work again, well I found my joy.

In my new job I am working as Machine Vision programmer and luckily I have a chance to work with C# and .NET platform.
So I will have a loot of C# code on my remote. We are also using HALCON (http://www.mvtec.com/products/halcon/) sw, and I can say it does the work. With HALCON it is very easy to solve complicated vision tasks.
